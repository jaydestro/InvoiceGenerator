# Invoice Generator

The Invoice Generator is a user-friendly console application designed to generate, store, and manage invoices. Utilizing the power of MongoDB hosted on Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Blob Storage, users can efficiently create invoices, save them as PDFs, and retrieve them with ease. The application also calculates the sales tax based on the provided state code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK.

- A running MongoDB server on `localhost:27017`.

- Azure Blob Storage account and container.

- Properly configured `appsettings.json` with MongoDB and Azure Blob Storage connection strings.

Example `appsettings.json`:

```json

{

Â  "ConnectionStrings": {

Â  Â  "MongoDB": "mongodb://localhost:27017",

Â  Â  "BlobStorage": "your-blob-storage-connection-string"

Â  },

Â  "BlobStorageSettings": {

Â  Â  "ContainerName": "your-container-name"

Â  }

}

```

> **Note:** Adjust the connection string in `appsettings.json` if using a remote MongoDB server.
